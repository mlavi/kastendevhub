title: Protect your Postgres EDB database with Kasten
description: Kasten and EDB have worked on a partnership so that you can protect and migrate your EDB database using Kasten. With this partnership we get best of both words, a transaction consistent backup, based on storage snapshot and entirely managed by Kasten ! This will let you execute disaster recovery and migration scenario of enterprise database in just few clicks.

# Why database on Kubernetes ?

## TLDR

Want a quick introduction check this excellent video from my colleague Michael Cade.
 [![Protect your Postgres EDB database with Kasten](http://img.youtube.com/vi/pTmeUKD8sMo/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTmeUKD8sMo "Protect your Postgres EDB database with Kasten")

 Having your database in Kubernetes has several advantages :   
- **Performance** : you colocalize the data and the application
- **Security** : All stay within the kubernetes network
- **Ease of deployment** : `kubectl apply -f ...` and you're good to go. 
- **Automation** : You define your desired state, the operator make it happen.
- **Self Healing** : Benefits for all workloads in Kubernetes.
 
However there are challenges : 
- **Enterprise scale** : HA and big volumes are required.
- **Efficient Protection** : Incremental backup, transaction consistency.
- **Ease of use** : GUI and easy to use API. 
- **Skill shortage** : Database and kubernetes double skills are hard to find.
- **Migration and replication**  : we are more than ever in a hybrid momentum.

Especially the last one **Migration and replication** :  no serious player would want to get trapped with a single cloud provider. How can you negotiate your bill without the flexibility to move? How can you adapt to legal compliance changes?
How do you move and replicate accross the cloud and the datacenters ? 
 
EDB and Kasten together can overcome all these challenges let's see how. 
 
# How EDB and Kasten work together ? 

## EDB on Kubernetes 

[EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com) offer a full management of postgres clusters on Kubernetes. The only thing you have to do is create a custom resource like this one :

```
apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-example
  annotations:
    "k8s.enterprisedb.io/addons": '["kasten"]'    
spec:
  instances: 3
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
 ```
 
"Et Voila", you immediately get a postgres cluster with one primary and 2 replicas. If the primary becomes unavailable, the operator immediately handles the failover to one of the replicas and promotes it to primary. In addition to the failover, the operator automatically adds a new replica to bring the database to a desired state. All that automatically.
 
EDB is the company behind the very well known Open Source Kubernetes project [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io), and you can get support and professional services from EDB through their [commercial offering](https://www.enterprisedb.com/services-support/professional-services). You can see 
an EDB database as a managed database but without being tied in a cloud provider or a data center.


## Solution 

In it's regular run EDB manages the postgres cluster ensuring there is always one primary (read-write) and 2 replicas (read-only) to handle failover scenarios.

![regular run](/images/posts/2024-05-28-edb-and-kasten/regular-run.png)

When Kasten launch the backup it calls the command to "Fence" one of the replica. It means that the primary instance is not affected and all the transactions can continue on the primary. Customer won't notice any downtime or performance drop because of the backup ! 

![Before snapshot](/images/posts/2024-05-28-edb-and-kasten/before-snapshot.png)

When an instance is "fenced" , EDB guarantees consistency by committing all transactions to the database. This ensures that the backups taken by Kasten is a full consistent snapshot of the database.

When the snapshot of the "fenced" instance is complete, Kasten will "unfence" and the replica catches up with the last transaction that was missed during the fencing.

![After snapshot](/images/posts/2024-05-28-edb-and-kasten/after-snapshot.png)

During restore, Kasten restores the PVC that was fenced, and when complete the operator promotes it as a primary instance. Two read replicas are then created from the primary.

![At restore](/images/posts/2024-05-28-edb-and-kasten/at-restore.png)

# Let's try it now 

## Install the operator 

If you already have EDB operator installed on kubernetes you can skip this part  

```
kubectl apply -f https://get.enterprisedb.io/cnp/postgresql-operator-1.20.2.yaml
```

This will create the operator namespace where the controller will be running.

## Create an EDB cluster, a client and some data 


```
kubectl create ns edb
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/michaelcourcy/edb-kasten/raw/main/cluster-example-2.yaml -n edb
```

Wait for the cluster to be fully ready.
```
kubectl get clusters.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io -n edb
NAME              AGE   INSTANCES   READY   STATUS                     PRIMARY
cluster-example   19m   3           3       Cluster in healthy state   cluster-example-1
```


Install the cnp plugin if you haven't it yet 
```
curl -sSfL \
  https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/kubectl-cnp/raw/main/install.sh | \
  sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

Create a client certificate to the database
```
kubectl cnp certificate cluster-app \
  --cnp-cluster cluster-example \
  --cnp-user app \
  -n edb 
```

Now you can create the client 
```
kubectl create -f https://github.com/michaelcourcy/edb-kasten/raw/main/client.yaml -n edb 
```

Create some data 
```
kubectl exec -it deploy/cert-test -- bash
psql " $DATABASE_URL "
\c app
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS links;
CREATE TABLE links (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	url VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	description VARCHAR (255),
        last_update DATE
);
INSERT INTO links (url, name, description, last_update) VALUES('https://kasten.io','Kasten','Backup on kubernetes',NOW());
select * from links;
\q
exit
```

## Add the backup decorator annotations to the cluster 

Skip this step if you have created the cluster using the instructions from the previous section. With cluster-example-2 the yaml includes the kasten addon.

If you haven't used the instructions from the previous section, add this annotation to your cluster CR 
```
    "k8s.enterprisedb.io/addons": '["kasten"]'
```

If your version of EDB is old and does not support the kasten addons you can create all the annotations and labels manually using the example in [cluster-example.yaml ](https://github.com/michaelcourcy/edb-kasten/raw/main/cluster-example.yaml). 


## Install the edb blueprint

```
kubectl create -f https://github.com/michaelcourcy/edb-kasten/raw/main/edb-hooks.yaml
```

## Create a backup policy with the exclude filters and the hooks 

Create a Kasten policy for the edb namespace: set up a location profile for export and kanister actions. 

### Add the exlude filters :

```
kasten-enterprisedb.io/excluded:true
```

![PVC exclude filters](/images/posts/2024-05-28-edb-and-kasten/exclude-filters.png)


### Add the hooks :

![Policy hooks](/images/posts/2024-05-28-edb-and-kasten/policy-hooks.png)


## Launch a backup 

Launch a backup, this creates 2 restorepoints a local and a remote.

![Launch a backup](/images/posts/2024-05-28-edb-and-kasten/launch-a-backup.png)

When checking the kasten restore point you can notice that only one PVC has been backed up (the one that was "fenced").

![Only one pvc has been backed up](/images/posts/2024-05-28-edb-and-kasten/only-one-pvc-backed-up.png)

## Let's test a restore

Delete the namespace edb 

```
kubectl delete ns edb
```

## Restore 

Because you deleted the namespace all the volumesnaphot are gone hence you need to restore from the external
location profile.

![Choose exported](/images/posts/2024-05-28-edb-and-kasten/choose-exported.png)

Just click restore and wait for the EDB cluster to restart.

![click restore](/images/posts/2024-05-28-edb-and-kasten/restore-edb.png)

You should see pod cluster-example-2 immediatly starting (without initialization of the database) and the cluster-example-3 and cluster-example-4 joining.

```
kubectl get po -n edb -w

```

### Check your data are back.

As Kasten restores everything that was backed up by default it has also restored the client. Connect to the client and check the data.

```
kubectl exec -it deploy/cert-test -- bash
psql " $DATABASE_URL "
\c app
select * from links;
\q
exit
```

You should see your data back 
```
app=> select * from links;
 id |        url        |  name  |     description      | last_update 
----+-------------------+--------+----------------------+-------------
  1 | https://kasten.io | Kasten | Backup on kubernetes | 2024-03-25
```

# Conclusion 

This partnership between Kasten and EDB is really a great opportunity for devops that were looking for a postgres managed 
database without being tied to a specific cloud provider. Now your database is fully managed and you can migrate it seamlessly in 
your different Kubernetes clusters.
